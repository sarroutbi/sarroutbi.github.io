## Welcome to sarroutbi blog

This is a very basic blog, to store different topics regarding my day to day work on Open Source, and in particular for the different projects inside Red Hat where I am contributing.

### NBDE
I mainly work on [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053). These are the main repositories related to this technology:
* [clevis](https://github.com/latchset/clevis)
* [jose](https://github.com/latchset/jose)
* [luksmeta](https://github.com/latchset/luksmeta)
* [tang](https://github.com/latchset/tang)

Apart from contributions to previous repositories, I am main developer and maintainer of `tang-operator`. This operator provides [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift), in particular, Tang server container deployment automation:
* [tang-operator](https://github.com/latchset/tang-operator)

Regarding tests, I collaborate with [RedHat Special Projects Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests/commits?author=sarroutbi) upstream tests repository. I work mostly with [tang-operator-tests](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tang-operator-tests)) test suite, although I have contributed to other test suites:
* [RedHat-SP-Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security) / [common-cloud-orchestration](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/common-cloud-orchestration)
* [RedHat-SP-Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security) / [attestation-operator-tests](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/attestation-operator-tests)

I also contributed to [DEE HMS](https://github.com/dee-hms/), an initiative to provide a Disk Encryption Experience Hosted Managed Service in [ConsoleDot](https://github.com/RedHatInsights). Here are the repositories that were created regarding this project:
* [dee-hms-deployment](https://github.com/dee-hms/dee-hms-deployment)
* [socat-tang-filter](https://github.com/dee-hms/socat-tang-filter)
* [tang-adv-displayer](https://github.com/dee-hms/tang-adv-displayer)
* [tang-iam-proxy](https://github.com/dee-hms/tang-iam-proxy)

### Keylime
Lately, I have started contributing to [Keylime](https://keylime.dev/) project, and, in particular, to next repositories:
* [attestation-operator](https://github.com/keylime/attestation-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asarroutbi)
* [attestation-operator-tests](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/attestation-operator-tests/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asarroutbi)
* [rust-keylime](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asarroutbi)

### Articles
I have written and/or co-written some articles for different Red Hat blogs/pages, mostly on different aspects of [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) technology:
* [Clevis performance improvements](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/clevis-performance-improvements)
* [NBDE (Network-Bound Disk Encryption) Technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053)
* [Tang-Operator: Providing NBDE in OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/tang-operator-providing-nbde-in-openshift)
