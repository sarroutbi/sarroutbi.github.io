## Welcome to sarroutbi blog

This is a very basic blog, to store different topics regarding my day to day work on Open Source, and in particular for the different projects inside Red Hat where I am contributing.

### Articles
I have written and/or co-written some articles for different Red Hat blogs/pages, mostly on different aspects of [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) technology:
* [Clevis performance improvements](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/clevis-performance-improvements)
* [NBDE (Network-Bound Disk Encryption) Technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053)
* [Tang-Operator: Providing NBDE in OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/tang-operator-providing-nbde-in-openshift)
